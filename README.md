# Real-Time Facial Expression Detection

This project implements a real-time facial expression detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python. It classifies facial expressions into three categories: **sad**, **happy**, and **surprise**. The system captures live video feed from a webcam and displays the predicted expression on the video.

## Overview
This project is designed to detect facial expressions in real-time using a pre-trained model on a dataset containing images categorized as **sad**, **happy**, and **surprise**. It is organized into separate scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and real-time detection.

## Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-detection.git
cd facial-expression-detection

## Prepare Dataset
The dataset used for this project is not included. Ensure your dataset is organized as follows:
dataset/
├── sad/
├── happy/
└── surprise/

Note: This repository does not include any pre-trained models or datasets due to size and privacy limitations. Make sure to prepare your dataset and follow the setup instructions carefully.

This `README.md` provides a full setup guide and clear instructions for usage, covering dependencies, data preparation, and each script’s function within the project. Let me know if any additional details are needed!
